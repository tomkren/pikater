## Dependencies

Dependencies are represented by the following diagram:

{{{{{{ blue-modern
	Core->Shared: requires
	Web->Shared: requires
	alt web-app is in online mode
		Web->Core: requires
	end
}}}}}}

`Core` and `shared` packages are and aim to be completely independent of `web`, but as a standalone unit, they are also very limited in usage and user-experience.

`Web` is only dependent on `core` when it is in "online mode" (see [[web application documentation|Web-documentation#conf]]). To be precise, `web` only calls methods defined in the following class:

```java:/src/org/pikater/core/agents/gateway/WebToCoreEntryPoint.java```
