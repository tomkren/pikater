/**
 * As stated in the Javadoc of {@link IMyUploadReceiver}, this implementation
 * strives to replace the <a href="http://goo.gl/7XF84Z">original receiver
 * implementation</a> in Vaadin's 'MultiFileUpload' plugin to:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Give us more control over the construction of the server-side file.
 * <li> Unbind handling of the uploaded file from Vaadin (not to succumb to
 * request timeout).
 * <li> Give the handler more information about the file. Pass {@link File}
 * instead of {@link InputStream}.
 * <li> To use server-global implementation of creating temporary files.
 * </ul>
 * <font color="red">At the same time, doing so is a drawback for future Vaadin or plugin updates.
 * Newer versions (especially the plugin) may not support hacks like these.</font>
 * 
 * When (re-)implementing this class, it is advised to consult the 
 * <a href="http://goo.gl/piWOPJ">original UploadStatePanel implementation</a>.
