/**
 * Interface useful to implement if you wish to:
 * <ul>
 * <li> allow the user to continue browsing even before all uploads finish,
 * <li> unbind handling of the uploaded file from Vaadin (allowing the user to
 * log out or switch views before the actual handling finishes).
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <font color="red">THE PROBLEM: </font> All parent components or UIs of upload buttons created with the
 * {@link org.pikater.web.vaadin.UserUploads#createUploadButton createUploadButton}
 * method has to be attached for as long as an upload is in progress, otherwise the upload is interrupted
 * and fails.</br></br>
 * 
 * <font color="red">THE SOLUTION: </font> don't detach the parent components, only hide them
 * in the {@link #uploadStarted} method, e.g. {@link com.vaadin.ui.AbstractComponent#setVisible setVisible(false)}.
