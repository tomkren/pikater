<!-- title: GitHub overview -->

This project extends the [Pikater](https://github.com/peskk3am/pikater4) project with multi-user support, web based GUI and distributed infrastructure to allow simultaneous computation of many individual tasks.

As such, this application consists of 3 main parts:

1. **Core system**  
The original pikater project. Although it has been rewritten to support the extension, it still works as a standalone unit.
2. **Database framework**
3. **Web application extension**

The project also contains an inline documentation written in markdown, easily available as a wiki.
More information on each of these "components" can be found in the [documentation](#docs).




## Main features

Client:
* 2D editor to define experiments (boxes and edges style).
* Potentially many experiments may be scheduled to execution.
* Displaying the experiment results and converting/downloading them into a human-readable format, such as CSV.
* Uploading custom data sets and computation methods.

Server:
* Many features of the original Pikater project, such as computation method recommendation.
* Experiments planning and execution.
* Saving of trained models which can then be used in further experiments.
* Administrator functions, such as supervision of all scheduled experiments.


## Life-cycle

The project's GitHub repository can be found at https://github.com/krajj7/pikater.

### Installation

First and foremost, note several things:

1. The repository has several branches. Two of them are important:
	* `master` - contains the latest core system version.
	* `Eclipse-Vaadin-project` - contains the latest GUI (web application) and documentation versions.
2. This project requires:
    * Java version 7,
	* a JPA-compatible database (at this moment, only PostgreSQL database is supported) running locally or externally,
	* a SMTP server open for local connections.


#### Database

1. Install PostgreSQL database, that can be downloaded from the address of [PostgreSQL download site](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) or use package manager of your system. Pikater was tested with version 9.3 and it is highly recommended to use this version.
2. Create a new database with a name of your desire. Using UTF-8 character encoding is recommended.
3. When you clone the project on your machines in later steps, change the following files accordingly to your fresh database install:
    * `src/beans.xml`
    * `src/META-INF/persistence.xml`
4. After cloning the project you can use utility `org.pikater.shared.database.util.initialisation.DatabaseInitialisation` to generate the configuration files as well as to create the first administrator user of Pikater.
```

|                           WELCOME to PIKATER                                 |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you can run the system some configuration files must be generated.
These files are stored in plain text format, so make sure, that can't be read
by anyone.
Also some default database entries will be generated, which contains the first
user with administrator priviledge. Password of this user is stored as hash
in the database.

Please choose, which part of initialisation would you like to run:
Whole DB initialisation: 'a'
Config file generation : 'c'
Just DB initialisation : 'd'
```
Initial console output of the utility is shown above.

#### Core system

Clone the `master` branch on target machine.

#### Extension

Import the project in Eclipse:

1. Install [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
2. Install the [Vaadin plugin for Eclipse](http://vaadin.com/eclipse).
3. Clone the `Eclipse-Vaadin-project` branch on target machine.
4. Create a new Vaadin project, as specified [here](https://vaadin.com/book/-/page/getting-started.first-project.html). **You must name it `Pikater-Extension` and use Vaadin version `7.1.14`**.
5. Overwrite the created project with the cloned pikater branch.
6. Check your project's Java binding - it might have been corrupted in the last step. Check the `.classpath` file.
5. Compile the `org.pikater.web.vaadin.gui.PikaterWidgetset.gwt.xml` widgetset.
6. Inspect/edit the `WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml` file. It is used to configure the web application. Detailed information can be found [[here|Web-documentation#conf]].
7. Install and prepare a servlet container (e.g. Apache Tomcat).

### Deployment & launching

#### Database

Make it publicly available to the machines you wish to run core system or extension on.

#### Core system

Deployment was already done in installation.  
To launch the core system, execute the `Launch-core.launch` configuration.

#### Extension

The extension requires an instance of core system running locally so install and launch it first.

To deploy and launch the extension:

1. Start the servlet container.
2. Export the extension into a `.war` file from Eclipse, deploy it into the servlet container.
3. Start the deployed application.
4. Access the page, e.g. go to `http://localhost:8080/Pikater` (for Apache Tomcat; by default) or `http://my.domain/Pikater`. A login dialog will appear.
5. Enter the default login and password (see above) and start using. User guide can be found [[here|User-guide]].

### Maintenance

If the extension is used, one or more administrators may need to manage it using the GUI. Otherwise, the application should be self-maintained.

## Wiki

This project contains inline documentation written in markdown, easily available as a wiki.
